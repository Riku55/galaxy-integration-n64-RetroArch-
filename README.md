# Retro GOG
RetroArch integrations for GOG Galaxy 2.0

## About 
The goal of this project is to integrate all retro platforms that are supported by both [GOG Galaxy 2.0](https://www.gog.com/galaxy) and [RetroArch](https://retroarch.com/) so that games can easily be launched from GOG with minimal user configuration.  GOG Galaxy will track user's play time as well as achievement status from [RetroAchievements.org](https://retroachievements.org).  These integrations are designed for and have only been tested with Windows.

This project is currently a work in progress.  Bugs may be present.
